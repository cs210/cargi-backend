# cargi-app

Instructions for running the iOS App:
To run the iOS app, you must import the GoogleMaps framework, which is stored in our Google Drive due to its large size. Place the GoogleMaps.framework file in iOS > CargiApp > Pods > GoogleMaps > Frameworks. IMPORTANT: do not use .xcodeproject file to open Xcode; use iOS > CargiApp > CargiApp.xcworkspace instead.
